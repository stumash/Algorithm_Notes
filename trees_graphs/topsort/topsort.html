<h2 id="dag-and-their-topological-ordering">DAG and their Topological Ordering</h2>
<p>DAGs, directed acyclic graphs, inherently have a topological order. In fact, there are<br />
usually multiple valid topological orderings. A topological sorting algorithm is a<br />
procedure that produces one such valid ordering from a given DAG.</p>
<p>A topological ordering of a DAG is an ordered list of the DAG’s vertices where no node<br />
<span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> that can be reached by some path from node <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> appears before node <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> in<br />
the ordering.</p>
<p>One way to think of it is that in a DAG, if you can get to one node <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by starting at<br />
another node <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then in a sense <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is kind of like one of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>’s ancestor nodes. So the<br />
rule for a topological ordering is that all ancestors must appear before their descendants<br />
in the topological ordering.</p>
<p>Here is a graphic to show a graph in its adjacency list form, it’s graph diagram form,<br />
and a valid topological ordering of the graph.</p>

<h2 id="topological-sorting">Topological Sorting</h2>
<p>The main idea in producing a topological ordering is to collect the leaf nodes and realize<br />
that we should stick them at the end of our ordering right off the bat. That way they<br />
automatically will come after their ancestors and they don’t have any descendants that<br />
we need to avoid putting before them.</p>
<p>Well, it’s a little more complicated than that but that’s a crucial idea. In the end, a<br />
topological sort amounts to doing a depth first search with the added condition that<br />
every time we reach a node that has no edges leading to any other yet-unvisited node, we<br />
push it onto a stack so that when we pop everything out of it the nodes come out in the<br />
reverse order that they were pushed in. If we run out of places to go, we just pick any<br />
unvisited node and keep going.</p>
<p>Here’s some pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>Function topsort(Graph G, Vertex V):
    Mark V as visited
    For each unvisited vertex W for which there is an edge from V to W 
        topsort(G, W)   
    Endfor
    Push V onto S
Endfunction

Initialize an empty Stack S
Algorithm Topological Sort(Graph G):
    For each unvisited vertex V in G
        topsort(G, V)
    Endfor 
    While S is not empty
        Pop a vertex V from S and print it
    Endwhile
Endalgorithm</code></pre>
