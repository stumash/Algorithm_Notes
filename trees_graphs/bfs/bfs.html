<h2 id="regular-bfs-using-a-queue">Regular BFS Using a Queue</h2>
<p>The usual implementation of BFS uses a Queue data structure. To visit every node in the tree<br />
breadth-first, the algorithm is simple. First, you put the root node in the Queue. Then, dequeue<br />
one element from the queue and name it mynode. Enqueue all of mynode’s undiscovered children.<br />
Repeat until the Queue is empty.</p>
<p>This algorithm works fine for simply traversing the tree/graph in a breadth-first way, but what<br />
if you want to be able to access the nodes by level? Or what if you want to access them by<br />
level while also knowing who each node’s parent was in the previous level? Clearly, the Queue<br />
will not suffice.</p>
<h2 id="bfs-using-an-array-of-lists---one-list-per-level">BFS Using an Array of Lists - One List per Level</h2>
<p>So, what would be better? Well if we built up an array of lists during the BFS so that each list<br />
corresponds to a level, we would be able to access nodes by level. The speudo-code for doing that<br />
is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>Algorithm BFS:
Let every node have an isDiscovered boolean property
Let A[] be an array of lists, one list for every level of BFS tree
Set the level counter lcount=0
Initialize A[0] to consist of the single root node
While A[lcount] is not an empty list:
    Initialize an empty list A[lcount + 1]
    For each node N in A[lcount]
        Set N isDiscovered=true
        For each node N&#39; adjacent to N
            If N&#39; !isDiscovered
                Add N&#39; to A[lcount + 1]  //Similar to use of queue
            Endif
        Endfor
    Endfor
    Increment lcount by one
Endwhile</code></pre>
<p>This approach is good, no doubt. With <code>A[]</code> we can definitely access the levels of the BFS tree<br />
directly. The only drawback is that we can’t know which node <code>N</code> in the level above any given<br />
node <code>N'</code> is the parent in the BFS tree of the node <code>N'</code>. For example, we can go to A[n]<br />
and go pick the ith element in the list. We know that this element is n levels below the root<br />
node, and since it is a node we have its list of edges. However, if more than one of the nodes<br />
it’s connected to are in the level n-1, we can’t know which node is its parent in the tree.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this knowledge is rarely needed and will come at the cost of more memory<br />
usage as demonstrated in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="bfs-that-does-it-all---bfs-tree-adjacency-list">BFS that Does It All - BFS Tree Adjacency List</h2>
<p>So how can we do our breadth-first traversal while storing the enountered nodes in the most<br />
convenient data structure – a data structure that lets us both access the nodes by level and<br />
access the nodes’ BFS tree parent and children by node? We build an adjacency list<br />
representation of the BFS tree on top of the array of lists-per-level from the last section.</p>
<p>Our array of lists H[] will have one list for each node we encounter. The first element of the<br />
list will be that node’s parent node in the BFS tree. The rest of list will be all the nodes<br />
children in the BFS tree. With H[], not only will we be able to access the nodes by their<br />
depth in the BFS tree, but we’ll also be able to access their parent and children nodes.</p>
<p>One should note that there are implementations that improve the performance of accessing this<br />
information tremendously. For example H[] can be a hashmap of lists instead of an array of them<br />
which would let us access the list of nodes N’ adjacent to any node N in the BFS tree in constant<br />
time. The main point of this aside is that we can assume we can index into H[] using only a node.</p>
<p>That tangent aside, let’s see how we construct this array H[] during the BFS.</p>
<pre><code>Algorithm BFS:
Let every node have an isDiscovered boolean property  
Let A[] be an array of lists, one list for every level of BFS tree
Let H[] be an array of lists, one list for every node in the graph
Set the level counter lcount=0
Initialize A[0] to consist of the single root node
Set the node counter ncount=0
While A[lcount] is not empty
    Initialize the empty list A[lcount + 1]
    For each node N in A[lcount]
        Set N isDiscovered=true
        Let H[ncount] be the &#39;BFS tree adjacency list&#39; of N
        Set parent_ncount equal to ncount
        Increment ncount by one
        For each node N&#39; adjacent to N
            If N&#39; !isDiscovered
                Add N&#39; to A[lcount + 1]
                Add N&#39; to P[parent_ncount] //N adjlist gets child N&#39;
                Add N to P[ncount] //N&#39; adjlist gets parent N
                Increment ncount by one
            Endif
        Endfor
    Endfor
    Increment lcount by one
Endwhile</code></pre>
