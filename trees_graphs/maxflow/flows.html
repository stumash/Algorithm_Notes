<h2 id="flow-network">Flow Network</h2>
<p>A flow network is a plain-old weighted directed acyclic graph where the edge weight for any edge can be thought of as the capacity of that edge to transport value from the parent node of the edge to the child node of the edge.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Some quick notation: <span class="math inline">\(c(e)\)</span> is the capacity of an edge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. The above graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> consists of two sets <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, a set of vertices and edges respectively. Note that node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and node <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are special in that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the source node and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the target node. The source node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> has no ingoing edges and the target node <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has no outgoing edges. The target node is sometimes also called the ‘sink’ since flow goes in but not out.</p>
<p>Note that throughout this page I refer to flow networks as “s-t graphs”.</p>
<h2 id="cuts-and-flows">Cuts and Flows</h2>
<p>Let’s define another term: an <em>s-t cut</em>. An s-t cut is a special cut of an s-t graph where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in the cut and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is not. And here’s another term: an <em>outcutset</em>. An outcutset is the set of outgoing edges of a cut. Using these two definitions, let’s define one more term: the <em>capacity</em> of an s-t cut. The capacity of any s-t cut is simply the sum of the capacities of the edges in the s-t cut’s outcutset. Simple, right? Here are two images for reference.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Before we go on to talking about flows, let’s take note of the problem that we’ll be using all this terminology to define and solve: the minimum cut problem. The minimum cut problem is the problem of finding an s-t cut with the minimum capacity in the s-t graph.</p>
<p>Now we’re ready for flows. Just like every edge has a capacity, every edge also has a flow. The flow of an edge is simply how much of the edge’s capacity is actually in use. Clearly the flow of an edge can’t be greater than its capacity and it also can’t be less than zero. If the flow of some edge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> si <span class="math inline">\(f(e)\)</span>, then we have <span class="math inline">\(0 \le f(e) \le c(e)\ \forall e \in E\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about a special kind of flow, an <em>s-t flow</em>. An s-t flow is a set of edge flows for the whole graph such that for all vertices other than <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the sum of the flows of a vertex’s ingoing edges is equal to the sum of the flows of that vertex’s outgoing edges. Basically an s-t flow is just a set of flows for the whole graph where, besides nodes <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, all nodes’ inflow is equal to outflow (all nodes have net zero flow). Here’s a picture of an s-t flow:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="st_flow.png" />

</div>
<p>As shown in the picture, there’s an important idea we must discuss about s-t flows: the <em>value</em> of s-t flows. As shown above, the value of an s-t flow is the sum of the source node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>’s outflows. But why does that number characterize the entire s-t flow? Well, if you think about it, the total outflow of node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is actually going to be the net flow of any s-t cut! This also implies that node <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>’s total inflow is this same value, the value of the s-t flow. This property is shown in the picture below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="st_flow_value.png" />

</div>
<h2 id="max-flows">Max Flows</h2>
<p>Let’s take note of an interesting property of s-t flows: for any s-t cut of a graph, no s-t flow can have a value greater than the capacity of the cut. It follows naturally from this that the minimum s-t cut capacity of a graph is equal to the max s-t flow value of the graph. This is basically just the idea of the minimum s-t cut capacity being a bottleneck for all flows.</p>
<p>We can phrase this one more way: for any s-t flow and any s-t cut, if the value of the s-t flow is equal to the capacity of the s-t cut then, for that graph with those edge capacities, the s-t flow is a max flow and the s-t cut is a min cut. This is true because if the s-t flow is as big as some s-t cut capacity then you can’t make the flow any bigger but also if the flow is a valid flow then the max flow isn’t any smaller – this is clearly the smallest flow for which you’ve maxed out some s-t cut’s capacity.</p>
<h2 id="attempts-at-maxflow-finding-algorithm">Attempts at MaxFlow-finding Algorithm</h2>
<p>Maybe we can try a simple greedy algorithm to find the max flow of an s-t graph? For example, let’s pick some simple <span class="math inline">\(s \rightarrow t\)</span> path for which all edges have capacities greater than their flows. Our strategy will be to just increase the flow on all the edges of the path by the same amount until we can’t. Then we’ll just move to another path with un-maxed-out capacities all along it and repeat. The idea is that if we do this for every path that we can, we will have maxed-out to capacity all the flows in our s-t graph. Unfortunately, this won’t work. Here’s a counter-example where we apply the strategy and it fails:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="greedy_fails.png" />

</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="greedy_opt.png" />

</div>
<p>Why did it fail? We maxed out certain edges and then weren’t able to find any <span class="math inline">\(s \rightarrow t\)</span> paths whose <em>every</em> edge has room for more flow – even though there will be many paths where <em>many</em> of the edges have much more room for flow. Clearly, as shown in the optimal solution, we will need to somehow take into account that the distribution of flows in the max flow is not so simple that our basic greedy algorithm can find it without screwing itself over.</p>
<p>Most importantly, notice that what we seem to be missing is some kind of way to backtrack and decide to redistribute flow in some way so as to make room for adding more flow in total.</p>
<h2 id="augmenting-paths">Augmenting Paths</h2>
<p>The failed strategy we just described involved finding a certain kind of <span class="math inline">\(s \rightarrow t\)</span> path – an <strong>augmenting path</strong>. As it was described above, it’s a path along which every single edge has not had its flow maxed out to capacity. In other words, an augmenting path is a path along which we can still <strong>augment</strong> the flow of each edge by at least some (possibly different) amount. That amount is called the <strong>residual capacity</strong> of each edge. The residual capacity of an edge is therefore its capacity minus its flow.</p>
<p>Of all the edges in an augmenting path, there will be one or more that have the smallest residual capacity. When we augment the flow along the augmenting path, we will only be able to augment as much as the smallest residual capacity in the path. The other edges in the path might have much larger residual capacities that are being wasted. If we broaden our definition of an augmenting path, we might be able to add and redistribute flow so that less residual capacity goes to waste.</p>
<p>Let’s now say that an augmenting path isn’t just a path from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> where we travel forward along edges that have a non-zero residual capacity. Instead, let’s say that we can also travel backwards along edges that have a non-zero flow. How can this work? Consider the following figure, which is a depiction of some small portion of a much larger s-t graph:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="backpath.png" />

</div>
<p>Even though edge <span class="math inline">\((A,B)\)</span> has a residual capacity of 3, we can’t augment the flow by that amount since the increased flow will have nowhere to go. But, the net flow of node <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will not change if we just decrease the inflow to it from another edge by 3 to compensate for our increase. Of course, if we do this, by (for example) decreasing the flow along edge <span class="math inline">\((C,B)\)</span>, we will have to increase the flow along some edge coming out of node <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. This is shown below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="backpath2.png" />

</div>
<p>We can think of what we just did as treating the entire path of three edges, including the backward one, as part of one augmenting path – an augmenting path that includes backwards edges. We were able to include backwards edges in our augmenting path using the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An augmenting path goes along forward edges with non-zero residual capacity and backward edges with non-zero flow. The bottleneck capacity of the augmenting path is the smallest residual capacity of a forward edge or flow of a backward edge (whichever is smallest).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have a better definition of an augmenting path. The new definition lets us go backward along edges which, effectively, serves to redistribute flow and avoid the problem of our first attempt at an algorithm.</p>
